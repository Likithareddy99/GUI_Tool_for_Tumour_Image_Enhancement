# GUI_Tool_for_Tumour_Image_Enhancement

Globally, cancers are predominantly causes deaths in men and women and most of them are
Lung, Brain and Prostate, etc. tumors are
malignant in nature.

Since Tumors are highly vascular, these tumors
destroy healthy tissues around them and invade
other organs.

If detected early, most of such patients can
survive and in some cases with little or no
recurrence even after five years.

In the light of the above facts, an Image
processing tool was designed and developed to
apply around 12 image filtering techniques like
Mean, Median, Gaussian, Wiener etc using
MATLAB to enhance the MRI tumor image quality

This tool is useful to doctors in diagnosis phase for
early detection of tumor to save the patient by
appropriate treatment.

Apart from that the performances of various filters
were also estimated using MSE, PSNR and SSIM
values.
